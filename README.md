Files for AAPS version 2.8.1.1


Changes since version 2.7.1
1. autoISF uses its own variables autoisf_max and autoisf_hoirlychange and no longer the Autosense parameters
   This means the effects f the two methods are now decoupled
2. these new variables are defined by the user in an extended menu
