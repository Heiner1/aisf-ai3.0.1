# autoISF
The autoISF add-on to AAPS V3.1.0.2 using oref1 can adapt ISF if glucose or its trends show certain behaviour. See the Quick Guide for details of those scenarios. The effects can be tuned individually to further improve your results if you already have a TIR of about 90%.

**DO NOT USE IT WITH LIBRE CGMs**

Currently the repo with the complete code can be found here: https://github.com/T-o-b-i-a-s/AndroidAPS/tree/3.1.0.2-ai2.2.7
Beware that in Android Studio you first start with its related master branch, wait for all the downloading and other updates and only finally switch to the above branch.

The last update dates from 31-Jul-2022 to include a safety switch to first enable the new SMB ON/OFF method before you can use it.
