# autoISF
The directory **autoISF2.1_dev** contains AAPS files modified and documentation for the purpose of using the prototype autoISF algorithm. It is still a develpment version of extending autoISF for a limited user group.

The directory **pp** contains the what-if scripts for the AAPS emulator, especially adapted to be used in conjunction with autoISF2.1_dev


**DO NOT USE IT WITH LIBRE CGMs**

The only tested versions are in folders *AAPS_files* and *AAPS_files_incl_varSMB* in the branch "2.8.2".
