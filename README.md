Files for AAPS version 2.8.1.1
Here, only those files are included that need to be replaced in the original release

Changes since version 2.7.1
1. autoISF uses its own variables autoisf_max and autoisf_hourlychange and no longer the Autosense parameters.
   This means the effects of the two methods are now completely independant
2. these new variables are maintained by the user in a menu
